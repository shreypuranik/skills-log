# skills-log
An app to help organisations identify areas of skills expertise, and SMEs

## Background 

I volunteer at a community radio station, and we wanted to be able to identify what skills our membership had, so we can organise some informal/internal training to enrich the volunteering experience. 

## Stack

I plan to build this using Go, with the help of Bootstrap for the front-end. Local development can be aided by using Docker. 

## Deployment Notes

TBC
